incgraph provides tools for including graphics on full paper size. The graphics
can be centered for a given paper format or the paper may be resized to the
graphics dimensions. The main use case for the package incgraph is to transform
one or many scans or taken pictures to a PDF document. It can also be applied
for full paper size LaTeX created graphics. The package incgraph provides a tool
box with basic macros and a convenience user interface which wraps the
well-known includegraphics. Also, bookmarking is especially supported.
